## Getting Started

### What are Progressive Web Apps (PWSa)?

- progressively enhance web apps to look and feel like native apps
- They should be the following
	+ reliable: load fast and provide offline functionality
	+ fast: respond quickly to user actions
	+ engaging: feel like a native app

- Avg smartphone user: 87% in Native Apps vs. 13% in Mobile Web
- Pro Native App:
	+ People spend time in native apps because of push notifications
	+ home screen icons make access easy
	+ Access to natice device features like camera
	+ and possibly work offline
- Con Native App:
	+ learn two different languages
	+ Reach of Apps vs. Mobile Web: 3.3M active usrs vs. 8.9M monthly active users (avg on top 1,000 apps)
- PWA's vs Native Apps vs "Tradtional" Web Pages
	+ PWAs have the best of both worlds: capability of phone features and reach

### Comparing PWAs and SPAs (Single Page Application)?

- SPAs != PWA ==> wrong comparison
- they are completely separate
- SPAs can be turned into PWAs like regular websites can be turned into PWAs
- SPAs
	+ Powered by JavaScript
	+ Highly reactive (to user input)
	+ only one HTML file sent to browser
- PWAs
	+ uses a lot of JavaScript (but works without it)
	+ Aims to have high Reactivity
	+ Works with multiple Files
